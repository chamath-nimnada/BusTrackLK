Passenger App + Driver App + Admin Web App 

---

### üìÅ Overview

| Directory | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `backend/` | Microservices for admin, passenger, and driver operations. |
| `web-admin/` | React dashboard for administrative tasks. |
| `mobile/` | Flutter-based mobile apps for driver and passenger roles. |
| `docs/` | Contains architecture, API contracts, and deployment guides. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Simplifies running all services locally with Docker. |

---

### üß© Notes
- The project follows a **microservices architecture**.  
- `common-library` promotes **code reuse** across backend services.  
- `api-gateway` (if enabled) provides centralized routing, authentication, and rate limiting.  
- The structure is scalable ‚Äî ideal for future integration with CI/CD, Kubernetes, etc.

Would you like me to add **GitHub badges** (e.g., build status, license, tech stack) and a **visual architecture diagram** section next? It‚Äôll make your README look much more professional.
